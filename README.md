## Guideline
1. <b>For each sentence:</b>  
    * Identify all noun phrases and verb phrases, prepositional phrases from the sentence.  
    <b>Note:</b> If you cannot identify the boundary of the phrases, try to include as much information as you can.  
    (<b>e.g.,</b> “smoking is significant associated with the increase of lung cancer risk” -> (“smoking”, “is significant associated with”, “the increase of lung cancer risk”)

    *Compose these noun phrases, verb phrases, and prepositional phrases into semantic triples in the form of “subject – predicate – object”.  
      <b>Note:</b> <p>1) Subject and object are “noun phrases” </p>
      <p>2) Predicate can be “verb phrase”, "prepositional phrases" or   "noun phrases".  It is used to describe the relation between the two noun phrases.</p>
    <p>e.g., Noun phrases as predicate:</p>
    <ul>
        <p> "No significant associations were detected between serrated polyps(SP) risk and physical activity or hormone replacement therapy."</p>
        <li>Triple 1: “serrated polyps(SP) risk”  -  “No significant association” - “physical activity”</li>
        <li>Triple 2: “serrated polyps(SP) risk”  -  “No significant association” - “hormone replacement therapy.”</li>
    </ul>
    <p>e.g., Prepositional phrases predicate:</p>
    <ul>
        <p> "Smoking increase the risk of lung cancer for male."</p>
        <li>Triple 1: “Smoking”  -  “increase” - “risk of lung cancer”</li>
        <li>Triple 2: “risk of lung cancer”  -  “for” - “male”</li>
    </ul>
